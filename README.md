# Fog-Cloud-Task_Scheduling

Dataset for Task Scheduling in Fog, Cloud and Cloud-Fog Environments
================================================

In the attached Excel file, The specifications of the used computational Fog and Cloud nodes, and the IoT tasks are listed.

The numbers for the computational nodes in both environments and for the tasks were randomly generated within the mentioned ranges in Table 1 and 2, respectively in sheet 1 (Computational Nodes).

For both Fog and Cloud environments, 20 computational nodes for each have been used and their specifications were randomly set a shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively in sheet 1.

In the Cloud-Fog system, the computational nodes in both environments have been integrated with maximum 17 (16 Fog nodes + 1 Cloud node) computational nodes, at the optimum settings
